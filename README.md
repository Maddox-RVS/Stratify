## ✨ Project Overview

**Stratify** is a developer-first framework for crafting, testing, and simulating trading strategies.  
Strategies are Python classes that inherit from a base `Strategy` class and can be easily loaded into backtesting and paper trading engines, enabling fast iteration and streamlined development.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- 💻 **Developer-First Approach** – Code-centric design with flexible configuration.
- 🐍 **Pythonic Strategies** – Inheritable Python classes for defining strategy logic.
- ⚙️ **Optimizable Parameters** – Adjustable strategy parameters for testing and tuning.
- ⚡ **Fast Iteration** – Rapid prototyping and refinement of trading ideas.
- 📈 **Comprehensive Backtesting** – Evaluate strategies against historical data.
- 📊 **Live Paper Trading** – Simulate performance on live data feeds.
- 💡 **Extensive Technical Indicators** – Access a wide range of built-in indicators.
- 📋 **Detailed Performance Metrics** – Track detailed and customizable statistics.

## 📦 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13.2** (or compatible version)
- **pip** – Python package manager (usually comes with Python)

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maddox-RVS/Stratify.git
cd Stratify
```

2. **Install dependencies**  
```bash

## ⚙️ Usage

Stratify allows developers to build and test trading strategies by:

1. Creating strategy classes that inherit from the `Strategy` base class
2. Loading those classes through JSON configurations
3. Running them in backtesting or paper trading engines with minimal setup

```python
# Example
from stratify import Strategy

class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def start(self):
        # Ran once at the start of the backtest/papertrade simulation
        pass

    def next(self):
        # Your custom logic here
        pass

    def end(self):
        # Ran once at the end of the backtest/papertrade simulation
        pass
```

Run backtests or paper trading sessions with your configured strategies and explore your results via built-in analytics.
